I am a Ph.D. student at the Technical University of Denmark (DTU) in the Machine Learning for [Smart Mobility lab](https://mlsm.man.dtu.dk/), where my research primarily focuses on learning-based control for autonomous mobility systems, working with [Filipe Rodrigues](https://fprodrigues.com/), [Daniele Gammelli](https://danielegammelli.github.io/), [Francisco C. Pereira](https://camara.scripts.mit.edu/home/).  I completed my Master's degree in Electrical Power Engineering and Operations Research with distinction at RWTH Aachen University. As part of my PhD, I am involved in an [EU-wide project](https://show-project.eu/) on the real-world deployment of autonomous shuttles. During my time as a visiting researcher at the [Autonomous Systems Lab](https://stanfordasl.github.io/) at Stanford University, I worked on integrating deep reinforcement learning with established optimization and control methods to create efficient, robust, and safe RL, contributing to applications in large-scale transportation systems, operations research, and robotics.
